# MATLAB Error Handling Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in MATLAB programming: improper error handling. The `myFunction.m` file contains a function that throws an error if the input is negative.  The `bugSolution.m` file shows how to improve the error handling.

## Bug Description
The original `myFunction.m` does not handle negative input gracefully. It throws a basic error message, but it could be improved.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.m` file demonstrates better error handling, allowing for more informative error messages, or alternative logic to prevent errors altogether.
